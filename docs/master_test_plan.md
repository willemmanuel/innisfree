#Master Test Plan

###Installation Instructions Test
To test the installation instructions, we will follow them to deploy our application to BlueHost. Once deployed, we will run all of the rake tests to ensure it is correctly deployed. Once that's done, we'll try to access the URL, just to make sure all the webserver loaded correctly and all the resources loaded correctly.
