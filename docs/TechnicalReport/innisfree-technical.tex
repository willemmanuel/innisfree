% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms,
somewhat loosely, to the formatting guidelines for
ACM SIG Proceedings. It is an {\em alternate} style which produces
a {\em tighter-looking} paper and was designed in response to
concerns expressed, by authors, over page-budgets.
It complements the document \textit{Author's (Alternate) Guide to
Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and Bib\TeX}.
This source file has been written with the intention of being
compiled under \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX.

The developers have tried to include every imaginable sort
of ``bells and whistles", such as a subtitle, footnotes on
title, subtitle and authors, as well as in the text, and
every optional component (e.g. Acknowledgments, Additional
Authors, Appendices), not to mention examples of
equations, theorems, tables and figures.

To make best use of this sample document, run it through \LaTeX\
and BibTeX, and compare this source code with the printed
output produced by the dvi file. A compiled PDF version
is available on the web page to help you with the
`look and feel'.

\section{Introduction}
Innisfree Village is a non-profit organization located in Crozet, Virginia dedicated to providing a lifesharing community for adults with disabilities (Innisfree Village). In this community, about 40 adults, known as co-workers, live and work alongside 20 long-term volunteer caregivers in houses of 4 co-workers and 2 caregivers. In addition to these full-time volunteers, there are around a dozen part-time volunteers and a dozen staff members providing more specialized knowledge and care. Throughout the day, residents participate in a variety of activities to contribute to the community, including cooking, gardening, woodworking, and weaving. Volunteers, who have committed to serving at the village for a year and a half, spend much of their time working together with their co-workers and helping meet their needs. Meanwhile, staff members are responsible for much of the administrative and maintenance work necessary to keep the community thriving.

As a full-time residential community, Innisfree Village is also responsible for scheduling medical appointments and ensuring co-workers can make these appointments. This is one of the main tasks for the staff, requiring one staff position, the medical coordinator, to be fully devoted to co-worker medical care, while also involving many others. Given that the 40 co-workers of Innisfree Village have varying disabilities and medical needs, ensuring all the necessary appointments have been made and can be attended is vital. Our work for them will focus on overhauling this scheduling system. The current system used for this is primarily pen and paper. When an appointment is made, the medical coordinator writes it on a large calendar in the main office, before recording it in Excel for reporting purposes. When a co-worker has an appointment, that co-worker’s volunteer caregiver is responsible for taking them to the appointment.

One of the major issues with this system is its lack of responsiveness. Not only is it exceedingly slow, as it requires several steps to simply record an appointment, but caregivers are rarely able to make follow-up appointments in the doctor’s office, as it also requires several phone calls between the medical coordinator and the doctor to schedule an appointment. The current system also requires appointments to be entered twice, increasing the secretarial load required, and increasing the possibilities of errors. It also makes it hard to generate reports for specific houses or residents, as Excel doesn’t provide the same features as a full database system. Finally, it is not simple for the medical coordinator to remind caregivers about upcoming appointments. Since all appointments are recorded on the calendar, the medical coordinator writes paper reminders for each caregiver, and has to hope the caregiver will check their mailbox in time.


\section{Related Work}
There are several applications that were discussed with Innisfree Village as possible solutions.  The first one discussed was mainstream online scheduling options such as Google Calendar {does this need a citation?}.  While our system was eventually modeled on the view of Google Calendars, this kind of calendar was too generic for what our customers wanted.  It doesn’t allow for the management of residents, doctors, and volunteers, there are no user levels, and they are difficult to filter.  In addition, these calendars are made to be managed by one person and viewed by many, which did not fit in with the needs of this system.
	
In addition, desktop clients, such as Outlook, also have a developed calendar.  However, programs like this don’t fit with the way volunteers would use the site, which is mostly on their cell phones and wouldn’t support car sign-out features.  As with Google Calendar, there is no way to manage user levels.

\section{System Design}

\subsection{Users}

\subsection{Appointments}

\subsubsection{Appointments Model}
The appointments model contains attributes for the resident, the doctor, the date, the time, the volunteer assigned to the appointment, the appointment type, a notes section, and the Django generated id, created at, and updated at fields.  

\subsubsection{Creating, Editing, and Deleting Appointments}

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
\section{Acknowledgments}
This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional
%\balancecolumns
\appendix
%Appendix A
\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
\subsubsection{Citations}
\subsubsection{Tables}
\subsubsection{Figures}
\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsection{Acknowledgments}
\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
the .tex source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% This next section command marks the start of
% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
\section{More Help for the Hardy}
The sig-alternate.cls file itself is chock-full of succinct
and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
it useful but please remember not to change it.
