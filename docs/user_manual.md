# Innisfree Village Scheduling User Manual
## Basic Information
#### Navigation
Navigating the system is done by clicking internal links shown in navigation bar at the top of each page, as show in the screenshot below. \todo{insert screenshot}. This navigation bar contains links to home page that shows appointments, as well as to the house list, the doctor list, the car reservation system and the list of system users. On smaller screens, this navigation bar will collapse to a single button that can be clicked to reveal the entire bar.

In addition to using this navigation bar, there are number of links on each page. For instance, on the home page, users are shown a list of the upcoming appointments. Each line of this list contains several links, as shown below. \todo{insert screenshot}. The first few links take you to a brief profile for that co-worker, doctor or volunteer. The fourth link "Details" will take you to the appointment details page, allowing for simple navigation to each appointment.

#### Roles
There are 3 basic roles in this system; the workstation head role, the volunteer role and the administrator role. The workstation head role has the least privileges, and can only see the appointment schedule to determine if a co-worker is not present due to an appointment. Volunteers more power, able to view all appointments and create, edit, and cancel appointments for residents in their house. Administrators have the most priviledges, as they are able to view, create, edit, cancel, and delete all appointments. Admin users are also able to create and edit residents, houses, doctors, and users and run reports.
