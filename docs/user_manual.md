## Basic Information
#### Navigation
Navigating the system is done by clicking internal links shown in navigation bar at the top of each page, as show in the screenshot below. ![Navigation Bar](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7620/17031754770_94f36671b7_b.jpg) This navigation bar contains links to home page that shows appointments, as well as to the house list, the doctor list, the car reservation system and the list of system users. On smaller screens, this navigation bar will collapse to a single button that can be clicked to reveal the entire bar.

In addition to using this navigation bar, there are number of links on each page. For instance, on the home page, users are shown a list of the upcoming appointments. Each line of this list contains several links, as shown below. ![Upcoming Appointment List](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7706/17031572338_b0b42bdfc2.jpg) The first few links take you to a brief profile for that co-worker, doctor or volunteer. The fourth link "Details" will take you to the appointment details page, allowing for simple navigation to each appointment.

#### Roles
There are 3 basic roles in this system; the workstation head role, the volunteer role and the administrator role. The workstation head role has the least privileges, and can only see the appointment schedule to determine if a co-worker is not present due to an appointment. Volunteers more power, able to view all appointments and create, edit, and cancel appointments for residents in their house. Administrators have the most priviledges, as they are able to view, create, edit, cancel, and delete all appointments. Admin users are also able to create and edit residents, houses, doctors, and users and run reports.

## Workstation Head Role
#### Appointments (Home screen)
![Homepage](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8797/17033172399_1f5330d152_c.jpg)

This homepage allows for viewing appointments. Ten upcoming appointments, sorted by date, are displayed in a list(1) above a calendar that provides a monthly(2) or weekly view(3) for appointments. This list of 10 appointments is paginated, so you can click the buttons at the bottom of the list to see future appointments.

Just above the list of upcoming appointments are two dropdown boxes. These dropdowns are used to filter the list of upcoming appointments and the calendar view. The house dropdown(4) allows you to only see appointments for the selected house, while the resident dropdown(5) shows only the appointments for the selected co-worker.

To view a single appointment, you can click the "details" link for that appointment from the list of appointments. You can also click on a calendar day, and then click the "details" link for the desired appointment. This single appointment view shows the same information as the list of upcoming appointments, but also provides a Google Map window to show where the doctor is located.

#### Houses
This provides a listing of all Innisfree houses, along with the house's phone number and the volunteers and co-workers living there. Full-time staff members are in the "Office Staff" house, while workstation volunteers are in the "Workstations" house.

Clicking on the name of a co-worker on this page will take you to their upcoming appointments. To see the contact information for a staff member or volunteer, simply click on their name.

#### Doctors
This page provides a listing of all of the medical coordinator approved doctors. This list can be sorted by doctor name, type, address and phone number, by clicking on the heading of each column. Clicking on the address of a doctor will bring that location up in Google Maps.

#### Users
This page provides a listing of all the scheduling system users. To sort this list by name, simply click on the column heading "Name." This list can also be sorted by house, email address, phone number, and role.

Once you've done this, click the "See Available Cars" button. This will take you to page that shows you your reservation details. This page also has a drop-down menu that lets you select which car you would like to reserve, and a text field where you can put the purpose for your reservation. This allows other volunteers to ride with you if possible. Once you've filled out the fields on this page, click the "Save Reservation" button. This will save your reservation and take you back to the calendar to view it.

#### Admin Page
The admin page contains similar functionality to the Users page, in that it allows Administator users to create, edit and delete users. It also allows admins to mark other users as administrators by clicking the box under admin until it is green with a "Y" inside, or to turn on email notifications for users, again by clicking the box so it turns green and contains a "Y." This page also allows adminstrators to designate users as the medical coordinator. The medical coordinators receieve an additional email digests informing them of all the appointments happening each day, as well as a Friday reminder email about all the appointments in the upcoming week.
